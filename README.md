# Surfs_Up

## Overview of the analysis
W. Avy would like an analysis of the temperature trends for his ice cream and surf shop for the months of June and December to make a business decision on the year-round sustainability.

## Results
-In the month of June the mean temperature was approximately 75 degrees with a minimum temperature of 64 degrees, and a maximum temperature of 85 degrees.

## Summary
The months of December and June are very comparable and provide further evidence that this is the right spot to put the surf and ice cream shop.  
Two additional analysisâ€™ I would perform would be on storms for the site and lightening.
